# Mathematical-Modeling
For Mathematical Modeling Contest in September. This are useful tools we may use.
## ezga.m 
  * Using *Sheffield University's GA Toolbox* to optimize minimum searching of a function.

### Version 1.2
  * Enable *EnableNlnrSearch* to enhance local search.
  * Set *optimset.Display* to *'off'* to avoid extra output and time. 
  * **NOTICE:** Using *NonlinearInterval* to change local search interval in GA main search.
  * **WARNING: Total search time will be a little longer than before.**
  
### Version 1.1
  * Change *crtbp* to *crtrp* for better performance.
  * Remove *bs2rv* function and optimize bugs.
